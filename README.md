## Hello everyone, welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer who have 6+ years of development experience and have 5 years of professional working experience. I love coding, creating something concrete, observing the period which is from the beginning of the development to the final product! I follow the technology, learn new tools and combine them in a project to see what is going on there. That makes easy to decide which technologies should be used in a specified project.

In my professional working life I have done many projects by using some technologies such as **PHP**, **MySQL**, **RabbitMQ**, **Redis**, **Node Js** and many others based on **Full-Stack Web Development**. But different software languages are not an obstacle for me because they are easy to learn and to adapt quickly.

So I would like to introduce my self and my goals to you as a brief here.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I have some ideas which can be a product if I complete them. At the same time I'm looking for a job and for that I'm developing these ideas in different environments, technologies and tools. For example I almost completed one of the project which is created with **Java Spring Boot**, **React Js**, **Tensorflow Js**, **Firebase Storage**, **Three Js**, **MySQL** and a bit **Python**.

### :pushpin: What I will work on the next project

As you can see, I want to know useful environments and business logics and merge them when they are efficient for the project. As a result of this I decided to develop my next project by using **Node Js**, **React Js**, **GraphQL**, **MongoDb**.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

I would like to learn **Cloud Platforms**, **Big Data** and as a hobby **AR/VR**. Also in the next times I will create **Data Science** projects. Therefore I have proceed to learn them step by step!

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with

I want to manage the position of 3D object in a specified point on the 3D scene. To be able to develop this I need to obtain 3D world coordinates and move the object to these coordinates. In this case I have the points that the object will move on. What I need to help is that put this 3D object to this coordinates appropriately. I would appreciate for any help on that! :sparkling_heart:
